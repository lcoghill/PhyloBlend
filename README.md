Phyloboost
==========

Phyloboost is a python pipeline that allows the reconstruction, augmentation and visualizaton of the similarity-cluster-based tree sets constructed from an input dataset of sequences. The end point is a data object that can be explored or used to quantify the phylogenetic signal present in whatever dataset acted as the input. While originally developed as a tool to allow the synthesis and calculation of the phylogenetic signal in Genbank for Eukaryotes, it will work on any large set of DNA or RNA sequence data. 

* <b>Pipeline</b> - Actual software pipeline to generate, augment and visualize the clusters.
* <b>Tools</b> - Scripts helpful in setting up / configuring some pieces of the pipeline and databases.
* <b>Phyloboost</b> - [Web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) web application for visualizing the clusters, trees and taxonomy alignments.
