Phyloboost
==========

Phyloboost is a python pipeline that allows the reconstruction, augmentation and visualizaton of the similarity-cluster-based tree sets constructed from the Phylota pipeline. These trees are unrooted trees built from datasets encompassing all of eukaryota from Genbank with more than 60,000 genera. Phyloboost allows you to augment those trees by adding new sequences to the clusters, rebuilding the alignments and trees, and then attempt to build rooted trees from those trees sets via graph-based methods by aligning them with the NCBI taxonomy.

* <b>Pipeline</b> - Actual software pipeline to generate, augment and visualize the clusters.
* <b>Tools</b> - Scripts helpful in setting up / configuring some pieces of the pipeline and databases.
* <b>Phyloboost</b> - [Web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) web application for visualizing the clusters, trees and taxonomy alignments.
